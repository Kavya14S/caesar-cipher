# Caesar Cipher 🔐  

A simple implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** in Python. This program allows you to **encrypt** and **decrypt** messages using a shift key.  

## 📌 About  
The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number (key).  

For example, with a shift of 3:  
- `a → d`  
- `b → e`  
- `c → f`  
- … and so on.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Encrypt plain text messages with a key  
- Decrypt cipher text back to plain text  
- Preserves spaces, numbers, and symbols  
- Simple command-line interface  

## 🛠️ Usage
